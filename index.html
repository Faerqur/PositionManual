<p>People often ask me about communication. How important that is to Me. Well, it sure is. In
fact I think it is the most imporatant things of them all. Without communication there is no
interaction. Without interaction, there is no Femdom.</p>
<p>Now in Femdom, the communication is mainly a top/down thing. The Domme acts and the
slave reacts. But not only, the slave also communicates with his Mistress. Even if he is not
talking. Constantly he does. His body speaks to her. If she is able to understand that means.</p>
<img class="pull-right col-xs-3" src="./img/Chastity-inspection-by-Mistress-Ezada-Sinn.jpg" />
<p>But let´s start with the Mistress first. Naturally her communication will be giving orders
mainly. And it is of such utmost importance that the slave understands those correctly and
then immediately reacts to them. I really cannot stress this point enough. It is the basis of everything.
Mistress and slave will only be able to
reach this ultimate goal of total power exchange
if this basic understanding is there and
works.</p>
<p>So for the sake of enhancing the interaction of
Mistress and slave I have put together a manual
of basic orders that I think are crucial for every
Domme/sub relationship. This is not just a play
for a session in a dungeon. It is for real. For
Me, this is the way I communicate with My
slaves. It is our language. Always, everywhere.</p>
<p>In general he will first have to learn that he is
always “under” Her. In a spiritual sense and –
to demonstrate and also reinforce that in his
head – in a very practical sense too. So that
means that <strong>his head will always be beneath the
Female</strong>, he will always look up to Her and She
will look down on him. It shall never be the
other way round. If that is not possible, for
example because you are walking around in
public, he shall always be behind his owner,
never in front. Remember: <strong>She leads, he follows</strong>.</p>
<p>You will be surprised of the big impact that simple rule will have on your interaction.</p>
<p>The Domme shall see that he carries out the orders exactly as they are defined. His ultimate
goal will be to succesfully do so. This is why I have enclosed photos to show the exact performance
of the positions. I expect every slave who applies for a session with Me to know
these commands by heart before he comes to see Me for the first time. They are simple
enough to be memorized even by an unenducated male dog. If he does not, I´ll kick him out.
Period.</p>
<p><strong>Every order can be given in two different ways: By a spoken command or by a silent gesture
with My hands.</strong> The spoken command is just simply the name of the position, the gesture is shown beneath on the photos. If I want to use the gesture, for example when in public, I announce
that with the sound of a “clicker”. The clicker is a very useful simple device used in
dog training. It makes a short clicking noise that My slaves are conditioned upon. Upon hearing
this specific sound they will immediately get down on their knees (if not in public) and
look at My hands to “read” from there and then follow the given order. This is very convenient
because it allows Me to direct them precisely even over longer distances without the need
to yell around. The clicker is a perfect stimulus, it tells the slave that I am just about to interact
with him, it raises his attention and sharpens his senses. Ever seen a dog pricking up his
ears and swaggering his tail when called upon? That´s the idea.</p>
<p>These positions are designed against the natural comfort of the body in order to increase the
slave’s focus on the position of his body and make him feel more vulnerable, at his Mistress’s
mercy.</p>

<img class="pull-right right-img col-xs-3" src="./img/1-waiting/1-waiting-position-slave-458x1024.jpg" />            
<p>This is maybe the most important of
them all. At least the one that you will
use most often. Because as W/we all
know the slave´s live is waiting and he
sure will do so in Waiting Position.</p>
<p>The position of the head and the hands
is of paramount importance here. <strong>Face
down on the floor, palms up.</strong> By opening
his palms to his Mistress the slaves
shows his openness, his readiness to
receive whatever she has to offer. Never
let him get away with showing you the
backside of his hands when in Waiting
Position. I really cannot understand why
so many people get that simple thing
wrong.</p>
<img class="pull-left left-img col-xs-3" src="./img/1-waiting/1-waiting-position-details-152x300.jpg" />
<p>The gesture translates the message
of the position into body language.
The Mistress´s hand says,
“get down and then stay where
you are”. The moving hand subdues
the slaves body but at the
same time is also protective, it
says “submit to My power and
show that you are Mine.”</p>
<p>Remember, I talked about the
slave communicating with his
Mistress in the beginning? This is
a perfect example how he does.
his open palms showing upwards
match Her palms facing down. If
it goes right, there will be a flow
of energy between the dominant
palm and the mirroring submissive
palm. The body of the slave
communicates his submission to
the Mistress even though he does
not speak, of course not. he will
never speak when in Waiting position,
this is an absolute no-go.
Speaking would destroy his tension.
he will not even be allowed
to look up when in waiting position.</p>

<p>This will usually be the second position
he will assume after Waiting. His hands
behinds his back, at least stripped to the
waist (if not fully naked) he will present
his body for your inspection. Make sure
that he holds himself very straight, doing
a hollow back, in no case bent forward
or with a round back. His whole
body must speak of tension, readiness,
awareness, attendence for you.</p>
<img class="pull-left left-img col-xs-3" src="./img/2-inspection/2-inspection-position-details-344x1024.jpg" />
<p>The meaning of the Mistress’s gesture to
symbolize the position is obvious. Her
two opening and closing fingers silently
say “Spread your legs … make yourself
available for My inspection”.</p>

<p>This is what I call the sacred position.
The collaring is the divine moment of
transformation. The friction of the second
in which you and your sub change like in
a holy sacrament. You become the Owner,
the Mistress, the Keeper. He becomes
the slave, the object, the dog. Once
the collar is around his neck, he is yours.
<strong>Collaring is the strongest symbol of ownership.</strong>
The dog collar that stands for his
position as a slave, an animal, nothing but
owned property.</p>
<p>In collaring, the slave kneels in front of
me, upright position, hands behind his back, eyes down, humble. He will be waiting until I approach
him and close the band around his neck.</p>
<img class="pull-left left-img col-xs-3" src="./img/3-collaring/3-collaring-position-details-348x1024.jpg" />
<p>Always cherish this very special moment. Take your time.
Think of a high priestess performing a sacred ceremony in
front of her believers and followers.</p>
<p>Move slowly, make little pauses. Make sure that he is able
to hear and understand the little “click” of the closing lock
around his neck. By doing so, you will engrave the extreme
significance of this ritual into his slavish mind.</p>
<p>The gesture for „Collaring“ should once more be easy to
remember for you and your slave. You put forth your right
hand and then close it to clench your fist. The symbol is „I
am taking you, I am grabbing Your soul never to let it loose
again.“</p>
<p>For Me, <strong>the first collaring is a very special one</strong>. Because
once I collar a slave for the first time I make him Mine.
And that is forever, or rather
as long as I want it to last.
And as this first time is so
important, I have a special
ritual for that: I first lay the
open collar across My lap
while My slave kneels in
front of Me. Then the slave
will stoop down and lay his
head on my lap, face down,
so that his throat lays on the
collar. His head in my lap
like a little child. <strong>he is offering
himself</strong>, he smells My
crotch, his body asks Me to
close the collar and so to
make him Mine.</p>

<p>The name tells it all. He is her doormat.
The slave will lay on his back in front of
the Mistress. His belly should be close to
her feet. His arms are stretched out on his
side, palms – as in most postions- showing
up.</p>
<img class="pull-left left-img col-xs-3" src="./img/4-doormat/4-doormat-position-details-348x1024.jpg" />
<p>Use the doormat to clean your shoes. Step
on it. Great position to start some breathtaking
smothering too…</p>
<p>The sign with the hands is simple. The
Mistress will move her open hand, palm
up, from left to right and back. Her hand
so symbolizes the lying slave.</p>

<p>“Present balls”: In this position the slave will be on his knees, upright position, facing the
Mistress. His left hand will be behind his back and he will show his cock and balls to you
supported by his stretched out right hand.</p>
<p>Let him offer his most precious parts to You for inspection. Presenting his balls, he shows that
he knows that they are truely yours. Yours to grab, to squeeze, to whip, to caress, to kick, to
wank them. Whatever you feel like doing to them and so to him.</p>
<p>The command with the hand is once more easy to understand and thus to remember: The
Mistresses right indication finger points at the slaves genitals and slowly moves up and down
to symbolize the presentation act.</p>
<p>When he is in chastity it is the same command only with a different name: “Present chastity“.
This is to keep him aware that he does not have balls to show any more. All that is left of him
is only a pathetic cock in chastity. By putting him into chastity you have in fact taken his
manhood from him. Over time he will become
grateful that you did so. Because there is no
stronger means of control over the male and
therefore no stronger bond that could tie him to
you. <strong>Control his sexuality and you will automatically
control the whole guy.</strong> Believe me, this is
waterproof, no doubt about it. It is as easy as
that.</p>
<img class="pull-left left-img col-xs-3" src="./img/5-present chastity, balls/5-present-chastity-details-348x1024.jpg" />
<p>You will wear the key of the chastity device as
your trophy and as the symbol of his virility on a
chain around your neck. There is no stronger
symbol of your ownership. Play around with the
key when he is able to take notice, twirl it on the
chain, touch it, maybe even hold it between your
lips. He will know and feel in his cock what this
means, you are playing with your power over
him. This will absolutely arouse and frustrate
him same time. And this is the status that you are
really after: “aroused frustration”. It sounds like
a contradiction in itself but in fact it isn´t. It is
the state of mind that brings the “strong
sex” down on its knees and makes them what
they eventually all have to become sooner or
later if we play this cool: Warm wax in our firm
hands.</p>
<p>See that he always uses the right hand to present
the balls, never the left. Don´t compromise on
details. Details are so important! Extremely important!
Letting go on little details is like
leaving a little hole in the wall of control that
you completely want to put around him. And
believe Me, leaving the little hole, even if it may
seem so tiny that it is hardly recognizable, will
invite him to scratch and
dig and drill in order to
ever widen it. And if you
allow him to do, one day
the hole will inevitably
have become big enough
for him to escape through
it. And you will not want
that to happen. So, painstakingly
look for the
smallest cracks in the walls
of obedience to immediately
seal them once and
forever.</p>

<p>This is a very useful position even for
the non-smokers amongst you. As you
have noticed already, there are positions
for every body opening of the slave
to present himself to you in all openness
and vulnerability. This one here is
for the mouth. In Ashtray he will bend
his head back and open his mouth wide
to be ready to receive whatever you
feel like throwing into it. Cigarette ash,
the butt of your cigarette, your spit, the
warm golden liquid that is much to
precious to be flushed down the toilet…</p>
<img class="pull-left left-img col-xs-3" src="./img/6-ashtray/6-ashtray-position-details.jpg" />
<p>Note that he will not have permission
to swallow until given expressly. This
is especially nice with insertions that
leave a bad taste in his mouth so he
will have to fight the urge to put
away with it. Having him carry the
ash of a whole cigarette in his snout
is wonderful. As you deliciously
inhale your draws you will calmly
watch his ever intensifying inconvenience.
His mouth will soon dry
out and the desire for a simple gulp
will become overwhelming. Combines
nicely with a golden shower
after you´re finished with the cigarette.</p>
<p>The hand symbol for this command
is self explaining. The indication
finger of the Mistress moves
quickly up and down as if she was
detaching some ash from the tip of
her cigarette.</p>
<p>Some useful advice if you want to
stub out a cigarette on his tongue: If
you want to help him, spit into his
mouth just before applying the cigarette
and tell him not to swallow.
The additional saliva in his mouth
will protect his tongue from the heat
of the glow. If on the other hand, he
needs severe
punishment,
wipe his tongue
dry before the
act. The dry
tongue will be
burnt immediately
giving him
something to
remember for
days.</p>

<img class="pull-right right-img col-xs-3" src="./img/7-heel/7-heel-position-slave.jpg" />            
<p>The name of this position might be a bit misleading but I like it anyway. Very much I do. I
chose that name because “Heel!” is the most popular command for every dog and with this
command the slave shall come as close to being a dog as at all possible. So it is the most
“doggish” of all commands in the manual. This is why it is for sure one of My favorites.</p>
<img class="pull-left left-img col-xs-3" src="./img/7-heel/7-heel-position-details-348x1024.jpg" />
<p>“Heel!” is a general “multi purpose” position, basically to call him to the spot. The slave will
get on all fours beside his Mistress, to Her left. his head will be close to her left thigh but in
any case not touch it! Once she moves, he follows her on all fours, same pace, remaining with
his head next to her left knee, closely watching her feet as she walks. The slave will of course
make sure, that his head is a bit behind and never in front of her. he shall never make the impression
to lead but always to be led.</p>
<p>The gesture for Heel! is one that every dog owner knows and will use instinctively. The
Mistress twice claps her hand against the outside of her right thigh. So she demonstrates, where
she wants the slaves head to be. I know that the command calls him to her legs and not really
to her heels. Heel! just sounds so nice to my ears. I love it, when they are like dogs…</p>

<p>This is more of a practical, technical
position, used for your convenience, not
as symbolic as “Collaring” for example.
Ever so often you will want to shackle
his arms. May it be as a preparation for
a whipping, may it be to keep him
shackled in a dungeon, whatever.
“Handcuffs” is simply the easiest position
for you to do so.</p>
<p>The slave will kneel in front of you, his
eyes chastely cast down. He will stretch
out his forearms towards you, palms up,
as always. You can then easily
apply handcuffs, arm restraints or a
chain around his wrists.</p>
<img class="pull-left left-img col-xs-3" src="./img/8-handcuffs/8-handcuffs-position-details.jpg" />
<p>The hand sign of the Mistress symbolizes
the act of taking him. She
puts forth her right hand, palm up,
and then closes the fingers to form a
fist. This says: ” I grab you, I take
you under my control.”</p>
<p>Some slaves pathetically hold their
arms up and add all kind of silly
useless variations to “Handcuffs”.
Well, they just shouldn’t. It is
nothing but a convenient position
for you to shackle their arms.
Nothing more. Period.</p>

<p>This is for sure an important one as well.
Astonishingly, it is one of the newest positions.
Maybe that is because I used all different
types of punishment positions before.
You may have Your variations as well
but it sure is important to have like one
“official” position for punishment that the
slave will adopt automatically upon Your
command without a second thought. Is there
anything more important for a slave than
his readiness for the
Mistress’s punishment? Well, now thinking
about it: his eagerness to serve the Mistress
maybe.</p>
<p>I generally want all the positions to be assumable
without any furniture/pillars so
they can be used anywhere, anytime. The
Mistress might add toys and equipment for
Her pleasure if She has them at hand, but the
positions should be usable without them.</p>
<p>In Punishment Position the bottom of the slave
should be easily accessible. So, as you see on
picture, he will be standing, bent, with his hands
on the knees, waiting for he Mistress to choose if
She will hit the bottom or the back.</p>
<p>Punishment Position however has a possible variation:
depending on the severity of the impending
punishment and the spatial conditions at
hand, I might want to tie the slave up. In this case
I will combine the command with pointing My
index finger to the piece of furniture, torture device
or whatever, to which I want to affix the
slave. He will then bend over that with his ass at
the highest spot and his wrists and ankles next to
the best fixing opportunities.</p>
<p>The hand symbol for this command looks like
the Mistress is holding a punishment implement,
like a cane or a whip, ready to strike the slave
with it.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Position 10: Dismissal</h3>
            <hr class="fancy-line" />
<img class="col-xs-4" src="./img/10-dismissal/GIF-dismissal.gif" />
<p>Slavery never ends, sessions sometimes have to. Sad but true. So, there is a need for an official
command that ends the session mode and releases the slave back to a status that is a least
somewhat more humanoid. This is “Dismissal”. Upon this command the slave will retreat
from the Mistresses presence, still on all fours. he will crawl backwards, facing the Mistress,
until he is out of her sight. Once he has done so, he may rise and return to whatever work or
mission he is commissioned or allowed to do.</p>
<p>The hand sign of the Mistress is just a casual wave of her right hand. It tells the slave “Get out
of My sight and out of My way, I don´t need you any more <strong>for now</strong>.”</p>
<p>However, being inside or outside of the session: Mistress and slave should never forget who
and what they are. So also after “Dismissal” I will expect My slaves to treat me in the most
respectful and obedient way. You can be sure that they adhere to this concept.</p>
<p>So these were my basic ten positions now.</p>
<p>To all my female readers: I hope that you find them helpful in training and directing your slaves.
They are meant to make your life easier and the realtionship to your slaves clearer. Use
them for your comfort and pleasure wherever possible.</p>
<p>To all my male readers: Learn them all by heart, practise hard. From now on I will never
again accept meeting a slave not familiar with my commands. My reaction would be your
immediate dismissal, forever.</p>
<p>To all of you: Female Supremacy is not fun, it is not a game, it can´t be turned on and off.
Female Supremacy is here to stay. It is more than a lifestyle, it is a religion. It will make the
world a better place to live in. For all of us. The Manual is just one of the first steps into the
right direction.<p>
